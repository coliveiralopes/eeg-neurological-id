# EEG-Based Neurological Condition Identification using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for identifying neurological conditions from Electroencephalography (EEG) data. By leveraging signal processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, this work seeks to classify different neurological states or conditions based on patterns observed in EEG recordings.
